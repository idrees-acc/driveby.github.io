                      <p>
                        If you want to protect your investment, it's certainly
                        worthwhile. Don't be conned by dealers asking a small
                        fortune for paint protection. Our Services are
                        affordable and will protect your paint from chemicals,
                        bird droppings, UV damage and much more. Without
                        protection, your paint may become dull and damaged and
                        this can be very expensive to repair. Our paint
                        protection will last for about 12 months before we
                        recommend another application. It will keep your car in
                        tip-top condition and looking its best.

                    <h3>What is a cut and polish?</h3>
                    <div class="answer">
                      <p>
                        A cut and polish is a deluxe service that makes use of a
                        cutting compound/paste, which can remove fine scratches
                        from your vehicle. It is ideal for cars which exhibit
                        hazing or swirl marks. Once the cutting process is
                        complete, we will polish your vehicle to restore shine
                        and lustre and this will last for about 3 months.

                      I have an older car, should I bother with polishing and
                      detailing?

                    <div class="answer">
                      <p>
                        The choice is up to you, but in most cases, we would
                        recommend polishing and detailing. Washing alone will
                        keep your car clean, but regular polishing and detailing
                        will extend the life and value of your vehicle and will
                        also make it more attractive to future buyers.

                      How is your odour removal different from competitors?
                    </h3>

                      <p>
                        Many of our competitors simply spray a synthetic
                        chemical into your vehicle's cabin and walk away. The
                        aroma is usually cheap-smelling and only lasts a few
                        weeks. We use a Fresh Air Ozone Machine/Purifier, which
                        is a complete odour removal system. It will kill all
                        bacteria and bad odours at their source, keeping you
                        safe and healthy while also keeping your car smelling
                        fresh.

                      <p>
                        You should always apply wax after polishing, as
                        polishing merely enhances the shine of your vehicle but
                        does not protect it. An application of wax will protect
                        your paint for up to 3 months. It helps water to run off
                        smoothly and adds an extra barrier against debris.
